# Hemaka Pamodya's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website, showcasing my work as a freelance developer. This website is built using **HTML 5**, **CSS 3**, and **Bootstrap 5**. The interactive map is created using **Leaflet 1.9**.

### Prerequisites

Before running the website, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the **Live Server** extension.

**Live Server** enables us to launch a local development server with live reloading, making the development process smoother.

### Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the **Live Server** extension if you haven't already.
3. Click **Go Live** in the bottom right corner of the status bar in Visual Studio Code. This will launch a local development server and open the website in your default web browser.


### Viewing the Application
